A simple Android app to test behaviour of pre-Lollipop (Android 5.0, SDK 21) with sites that
no longer support TLS 1.0. Between SDK 16 and 20, Android OS had the ciphers for TLS 1.2 but
they were not enabled. The app is a demonstration of how to enable it for these OS versions.

See Florian Krauthan's excellent blog post:
